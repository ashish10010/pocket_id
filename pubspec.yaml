  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:     
    - family: Lato
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Lato.ttf
    - family: Lato-reg
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Lato-Regular.ttf
    - family: Lato-Thin
      fonts: 
        - asset: assets/fonts/Lato-Thin.ttf
    - family: Poppins 
      fonts:
          - asset: assets/fonts/p1.ttf

    - family: Poppins-Reg
      fonts:
          - asset: assets/fonts/p2.ttf
          - asset: assets/fonts/p3.ttf
          - asset: assets/fonts/p4.ttf
          - asset: assets/fonts/p5.ttf
